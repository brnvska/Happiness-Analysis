## Project overview
In this application of econometrics, we decided to look into how different econometric approaches can help us to investigate the factors that impact the happiness rate across various countries over a period of time. The aim of this research is to identify and analyze the key determinants of happiness, focusing on variables such as GDP per capita, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perception of corruption, and confidence in government.
